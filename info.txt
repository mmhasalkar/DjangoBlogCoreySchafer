Start a project:
	- django-admin startproject <project_name>

Start the app:
	- python manage.py startapp <app_name>

Create views in the app:
	- edit the views.py and create functions to handle the request
	- accept request parameter
	- return any valid HttpResponse or render template

Create URLs for the app:
	- create a file called urls.py in app
	- import django.urls.path
	- create url patterns into it associated with views
	- include this file in main project urls file using django.urls.include

Create Templates for app:
	- create a templates directory in your app dir, and create another directory with the same name of your app
	- here you can create templates with .html file
	- now install the app in the settings.py installed apps to do this,
		- open apps.py of your app
		- copy the app_class_name
		- edit the settings. py installed apps part
		- add your app there by putting your app_name.apps.app_class_name

Create statid files for app:
	- create a static directory in your app dir and create another directory with the same name of your app
	- here you can create static files like .css

Templating Techniques:
	- create a base template with all repeatative code like scripts, css, header, footer, navbar, title, etc
	- use {% load static %} to load all static files
	- link static file in head tag using {% static 'file_name' %}
	- use {% url 'url_name' %} for dynamic hyperlinks to you app
	- you can use {%%} for writting logic (loops, conditions, etc.) in template and {{}} to use variables in templates
	- use {% block <block_name> %}{% endblock %} to create blocks in your template and override them in each of your template

Database Migrations:
	- python manage.py makemigrations
	- python manage.py migrate

Create Admin(superuser) and manage Administration:
	- python manage.py createsuperuser

Create and Manage Databases for app:
	- edit models.py from you app directory
	- create model for you app for eg. Post by inhariting django.db.models.Model
	- add fields like model.CharField, model.TextField, etc.
	- use django.contrib.auth.models.User as a user model
	- after completing the model class run following
		- python manage.py makemigrations
		- python manage.py sqlmigrate <app_name> <migration_file_id>
		- python manage.py migrate
	- you can use shell also with following command
		- python manage.py shell
		- perform different operations here on database and tables generated here using
			- import models from app, or user models
			- <model_name>.objects.all()
			- <model_name>.objects.first()
			- <model_name>.objects.last()
			- <model_name>.objects.filter(<field_name>=value)
			- <model_name>.objects.filter(<field_name>=value).first()
			- <model_name>.objects.get(id=value)
		- you can also create objects in database directly here from shell
			- object1 = <model_name>(field1=value1, field2=value2,..., fieldn=valuen)
			- object.save()
		- get the set of user of a particular model
			- user.<model_name>_set.all()
			- user.<model_name>_set.create(fields)
	- to have your apps models on Administration dashboard, you need to register the model in admins.py file under your app directory with admin.site.register(<model_name>)

Creating users app:
	- python manage.py createapp users
	- register this app in installed apps in settings.py
	- create user forms
		- create forms.py in your users app

	- design user forms
		- pip install django-crispy-forms
		- add 'crispy_forms' in settings.py installed apps
		- also set CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK in settings.py as required eg. bootstrap4
		- load pack in template like {% load crispy_forms_tags %}
		- now you can use crispy filter to forms as {{ form|crispy }}

User authentication with login and logout:
	- import django.contrib.auth.views in your projects urls.py
	- create url for login and use view django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView.as_view(template_name='<your_template_path>')
	- also create url for logout and use view django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView.as_view(template_name='<your_template_path>')
	- use {% user.is_authenticated %} in templates to check whether the user is logged in or not
	- add LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL in your settings.py

	- create a onetoonefiled with user model from django.contrib.auth.models.User
	- also create one image field and add default value and a uploat_to path path there
	- open settings.py and set MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL variables with directory and url to access these images
	- go to urls.py of project and import django.conf.settings and django.conf.urls.static.static
	- set media root and media url to urls like urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
	- now you can access image of user profile with user object like user.profile.image.url
	- to create profile automatically each time a user is created and saved
